Crux
Live Demo

[Live Demo](https://crux-fsp.herokuapp.com/#/)

Crux, a Mountain Project clone, is a web app that allows users to find rock climbing routes, photos, and guides throughout the world. It makes use of a Rails/PostgreSQL backend with React.js and Redux on the frontend.

The project was designed and built within a two-week timeframe, though I plan to continue adding improvements over time.
