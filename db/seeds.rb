It is the pull of this roof , the routes crux , that garners the majority of the 5.9+ grade (estimated a 5.9+/10a move by the FA), the climbing that follows is solid 5.7 on terrain similar to its neighbors to the right. A longer draw is recommended for the first bolt.",
  "Crux starts out pulling the roof through the third bolt, then sustained face climbing until the last bolt where it mellows out on a slab to the finish on the ledge.",
  "Climb an easy slab then launch past a hollow pistol grip to begin the steep arete. Pass a thin, short crux section midway and continue to an anchor. 6 bolts.",
  "Climb up onto the ledge, a few steep moves on jugs on the left seam, lead to a slab and rest. Climb up, slightly right, on ever steepening, beautiful black varnished rock, to a bit of a crux near the top.",
  "A, or the, crux comes quick on this route. Climb the shallow cornercrack up past a 2 bolts, climb up, slightly right through a notch in an overlap. Continue up to the varnished, plated wall to a seam\\crack system that leads straight up to the another crux just below the anchor.",
  "Just like the name says, this route wastes no time getting to it! Climb the side by side, steep seams in the dark rock on good jugs, pinches, and edges to a steep face. Continue up the seams on super fun moderate steep face\\slab to a 5.8 overlap\\roof. Once over come, a fun romp up 30' feet of easy slab.",
  "This route is fun from the start to the finish. Start on the crack in middle of the crag, gain holds on the steep face on the right. climb up through a technical crux, (1st - 2nd bolts). jugs lead up the ever steepening wall to the roof, good holds lead you up and left, then back right to the anchors.",
  "Fun, thoughtful climbing leads to a definitive crux near mid-route",
  "Like its neighbor to the right, this route has a really fun, slightly technical start, with interesting climbing up to, (and beyond) the definitive crux just above mid-height on the route.",
