A longer draw is recommended for the first bolt.",

  "Just like the name says, this route wastes no time getting to it! Climb the side by side, steep seams in the dark rock on good jugs, pinches, and edges to a steep face. Continue up the seams on super fun moderate steep face\\slab to a 5.8 overlap\\roof. Once over come, a fun romp up 30' feet of easy slab.",
  "This route is fun from the start to the finish. Start on the crack in middle of the crag, gain holds on the steep face on the right. climb up through a technical crux, (1st - 2nd bolts). jugs lead up the ever steepening wall to the roof, good holds lead you up and left, then back right to the anchors.",

  "Sit down start on the northwest side of the boulder. This is essentially the first problem you see as you get to the boulder. A few powerful moves will take you to a large sidepull jug, where you begin to trend left and up on small holds.",
  "This route has about five different ways to be done, but basically you climb up the overhang using pockeys, slopers and crimps to a crappy grip about 9 feet off the ground, and then reach up and left to a cheesegrater for a hold, and finish by grabbing onto a large jug over the roof.",
  "Climb jugs to a large hueco/undercling. Pull onto the the slab for an exciting finish on crimps.",
  "Start at a good sized hueco. Pull up and onto the slab and follow it, via nice slab moves, to the top. For the tick don't escape right onto the arete.",
  "Climb the obvious rail from left to right. Easy moves provide encouragement, until the rail gets smaller near the end. Good incuts and determination help gain the sloper out on the right lip. Match on this and swing your right foot high and complete a classic.",
  "Stand-start with wide palms and make a tricky first move to get your right foot on (crux). Stem your way up to the good fin and jugs to the easy but great top-out.",
  "Teasingly easy entry moves lead to two height-dependent crux sequences. For most taller people like myself, its a wild lean out right with the right hand to a sloper-type thingy utilizing a left heel hook. A left hand power up to a bulbous crimp sets you up for the big, flying move to a killer jug! Match and crank off a few knobs and small but positive plates up off the deck, to the blunt top out.",
  "Stem your way up the shallow scoop into the 'dihedral' using good sidepulls, gastons and other edges. Exit right at the top of the dihedral or continue straight up for full value.",
  "Stand-start matched on a crimp and make a reach up to a high right-hand gaston. Climb straight up with another gaston to a perfect jug on the lip. Balancy, technical, and fun.",
